# Comparison with Standard Models

This appendix compares Unified Electromagnetic Toroidal Cosmology (UETC) with standard theoretical approaches where their domains overlap.

The purpose is not to replace or invalidate existing models, but to clarify differences in emphasis, scope, and interpretation.

---

## General Positioning

UETC is not proposed as a competing fundamental theory.

Instead, it is an interpretive framework focused on:
- electromagnetic field structure,
- geometric organization,
- propagation behavior in structured environments.

Standard models remain authoritative within their established domains and empirical success.

---

## Classical Electrodynamics

Classical electrodynamics provides the mathematical foundation for electromagnetic field behavior.

UETC does not modify Maxwell’s equations or their established consequences.

The distinction lies in emphasis:
- standard approaches often focus on local field solutions,
- UETC emphasizes large-scale geometry, continuity, and organization.

These perspectives are complementary rather than contradictory.

---

## General Relativity

General relativity successfully describes gravitational phenomena and spacetime curvature.

UETC does not attempt to replace or revise general relativity.

Where propagation effects are discussed, UETC offers an alternative structural interpretation in electromagnetic contexts, not a competing gravitational theory.

Any overlap is treated cautiously and without claims of superiority.

## Plasma and Magnetohydrodynamic Models

Plasma and MHD models describe the collective behavior of charged particles and fields in conductive media.

UETC aligns closely with these models in recognizing the importance of field structure and current systems.

The difference lies primarily in scope:
- MHD focuses on fluid-scale behavior,
- UETC emphasizes cross-scale geometric organization and propagation effects.

---

## Cosmological Models

Standard cosmological models address large-scale structure, expansion, and matter-energy content.

UETC does not attempt to replace these models in their current role.

Where UETC is applied at large scales, it is as a structural and propagational interpretive layer rather than a full cosmological substitute.

---

## Summary of Differences

Key distinctions between UETC and standard models include:
- emphasis on electromagnetic geometry over parameter fitting,
- use of effective propagation descriptions,
- explicit focus on structural organization.

These differences reflect interpretive priorities rather than contradictions.

---

## Scope Boundaries

UETC explicitly acknowledges that:
- standard models may explain many observations more completely,
- UETC may fail in domains where electromagnetic structure is not dominant,
- coexistence of multiple explanatory frameworks is expected.

Comparison is offered to clarify context, not to claim replacement.
