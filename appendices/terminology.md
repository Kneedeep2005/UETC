# Terminology and Conventions

This appendix defines key terms and conventions used throughout the Unified Electromagnetic Toroidal Cosmology (UETC) repository.

These definitions are intended to stabilize language and prevent ambiguity. Terms are used consistently according to the meanings specified here.

---

## Field

A physically realized electromagnetic structure capable of storing energy, transmitting influence, and exhibiting geometry.

In UETC, a field is not treated as a purely abstract mathematical construct, but as an entity with spatial organization and measurable effects.

---

## Toroidal Geometry

A closed-loop field configuration characterized by continuous circulation around a central axis and the absence of open endpoints.

Toroidal geometry is treated as a structural outcome favored by stability and continuity, not as a universal requirement.

---

## Density

An effective measure describing how electromagnetic field structure or medium interaction influences propagation behavior.

Density in UETC is inferred from observable effects and does not necessarily correspond to mass density.

---

## Propagation

The effective transmission of energy or information through a structured environment.

Propagation does not imply particle motion unless explicitly stated.

---

## Propagation Parameter \( u(x) \)

A dimensionless parameter describing effective propagation behavior as a function of position.

Defined as:

\[
u(x) = \frac{c_0^2}{c(x)^2} = n(x)^2
\]

where \( u(x) = 1 \) corresponds to the vacuum-limit reference case.

---

## Vacuum-Limit Reference

The idealized condition in which propagation occurs without measurable structural modification.

This reference is used for comparison and does not imply the absence of all fields.

---

## Structured Environment

A region in which electromagnetic field organization or effective density variation measurably influences propagation behavior.

---

## Observational Reinterpretation

The process of analyzing existing observational data under alternative structural or propagation assumptions without rejecting the validity of the data itself.

---

## Scaling

The recurrence of similar organizational or geometric patterns across different physical scales, without implying identical underlying dynamics.

---

## Framework

A structured interpretive system that organizes concepts, constraints, and expectations without claiming completeness or exclusivity.

UETC is explicitly presented as a framework, not a finalized theory.

---

## Non-Assumptions

Explicit statements of what the framework does not require, including speculative entities, violations of conservation laws, or modification of established data.

---

## Convention Notes

- Mathematical symbols are defined once and used consistently.
- Qualitative descriptors are preferred where quantitative precision is not yet warranted.
- Ambiguity is acknowledged explicitly rather than resolved prematurely.
