# Unified Electromagnetic Toroidal Cosmology (UETC)

UETC is an independent, first-principles framework for organizing and interpreting electromagnetic structure, effective propagation behavior, and cross-scale geometry in observed systems.

This site is a simple public entry point for readers asking:
- Where is the technical reference?
- What does UETC claim, and what does it not claim?
- Where are definitions, figures, and supporting documents?

## Status and scope

UETC is a working research framework. It is not peer reviewed, and it does not claim experimental proof. The goal is clarity, internal consistency, and observational accountability, with an emphasis on structure and mechanisms rather than mathematical completeness.

## Start here

- **Repository (canonical reference):**

- **Overview:** [UETC_Overview_v1.0](../papers/UETC_Overview_v1.0.md)
- **Core Framework:** [UETC_Core_Framework](../papers/UETC_Core_Framework.md)
- **Observational Implications:** [UETC_Observational_Implications](../papers/UETC_Observational_Implications.md)
- **Figures folder:** [figures](../figures/)


## Definition anchor

UETC uses an effective propagation parameter:

**Effective propagation parameter**

u(x) = c₀² / c(x)² = n(x)²  (vacuum limit: u = 1)

This parameter is treated as an effective descriptor inferred observationally and used to organize propagation behavior in structured environments.

## How to engage

Useful feedback in this phase includes:
- clarifying definitions,
- pointing out internal inconsistencies,
- proposing observational tests or falsification criteria,
- improving citations and organization.

General debate or speculative extensions are out of scope for this public reference site.
