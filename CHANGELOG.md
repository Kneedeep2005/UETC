## uetcref-v1.0 — Initial Canonical Release (2026-01-26)

### Added
- Canonical Core Framework document
- Explicit Scaling Framework
- Observational constraints structure, including:

  - galaxies
  - heliosphere
  - cosmic microwave background (CMB)
  - intergalactic medium (IGM)
- Versioning and change-control policy
- Citation guidance and licensing information

## uetcref-v1.1 (2026-01-28)

### Added
- DES / DECam late-time galaxy structure observational constraint.
- Geometric constraints section, including Clifford tori as reference toroidal geometry.
- TON 618 ultramassive black hole scaling constraint as an upper-bound case.
- Black hole observational constraints README for structural organization and scope clarity.

### Notes
- These additions extend observational and geometric constraints without modifying core definitions or framework parameters.
- No numerical parameter fitting or predictive claims were introduced.
