# Changelog

All notable changes to the Unified Electromagnetic Toroidal Cosmology (UETC)
repository are documented in this file.

Version numbers reflect **structural significance**, not publication status.
See the README for the full versioning and change-control policy.

## uetcref-v1.2 (2026-02-01)

### Added
- Galactic-scale observational constraints category populated under `observational_constraints/galaxies/`.
- Archived exploratory: density-gradient inference scaler (global rotation curves).
- Archived exploratory: illustrative NGC 2403 overlay.
- Updated observational-constraints indices to reflect partial population of the Galaxies category.

### Notes
- These additions expand the observational scope of UETC to galactic scales without modifying core propagation definitions.
- All galactic entries are explicitly exploratory, non-unique, and intended to motivate falsifiable future tests.
- No precision fitting, parameter inference, or claims of explanatory completeness are introduced.

## uetcref-v1.1 (2026-01-28)

### Added
- DES / DECam late-time galaxy structure observational constraint.
- Geometric constraints section, including Clifford tori as reference toroidal geometry.
- TON 618 ultramassive black hole scaling constraint as an upper-bound case.
- Black hole observational constraints README for structural organization and scope clarity.

### Notes
- These additions extend observational and geometric constraints without modifying core definitions or framework parameters.
- No numerical parameter fitting or predictive claims were introduced.

## uetcref-v1.0 — Initial Canonical Release (2026-01-26)

### Added
- Canonical Core Framework document.
- Explicit Scaling Framework.
- Observational constraints structure, including:
  - black holes
  - galaxies
  - heliosphere
  - cosmic microwave background (CMB)
  - intergalactic medium (IGM)

### Notes
- This release establishes the initial public canonical reference for UETC.
- No claims of experimental proof or formal closure are asserted.
