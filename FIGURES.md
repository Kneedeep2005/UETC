# Figures Policy (UETC Repository)

Figures in this repository are provided as **schematic illustrations** intended to clarify structure, terminology, and geometric relationships used in the UETC framework.

They are **not** presented as simulation outputs, fitted models, or experimental proof.

## Scope and Interpretation

- Figures are **illustrative** and may omit details for clarity.
- Unless explicitly stated, figures do **not** represent:
  - exact scale,
  - force magnitudes,
  - quantitative relationships,
  - causal dominance between mechanisms.
- Visual similarity to real systems does not imply explanatory sufficiency.

## Naming and Organization

All figures are stored under:

- `figures/`

File naming uses lowercase with underscores, for example:

- `toroidal_scales.png`
- `heliosphere_structure.png`
- `galaxy_em_flows.png`
- `ngc2403_overlay_normalized_u.png` — NGC 2403 rotation curve overlay on conceptual u(x) using normalized radius (illustrative, non-fitted).


## Captions

Each figure caption should:

- use the words **“conceptual”** or **“schematic”** where appropriate,
- state that the figure is **illustrative only**,
- avoid language implying confirmation, proof, or dominance.

## Attribution and Reuse

Figures are licensed under the repository license (**CC BY 4.0**). Reuse is permitted with attribution.
