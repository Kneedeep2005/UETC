# Contributing to UETC

Thank you for your interest in Unified Electromagnetic Toroidal Cosmology (UETC).

This repository is maintained as a **technical reference for a working research framework**. Contributions are welcome when they improve clarity, consistency, or testability within the stated scope.

## Scope of Contributions

Constructive contributions may include:

- Clarification of definitions or terminology
- Identification of internal inconsistencies or ambiguities
- Suggestions for improved organization or structure
- Proposals for observational tests or falsification criteria
- Corrections of factual, typographical, or citation errors

All contributions should reference specific documents, sections, or definitions.

## Out of Scope

The following are outside the scope of this repository at its current phase:

- General debate about cosmology or physics philosophy
- Speculative extensions not grounded in the existing framework
- Claims of experimental proof or validation
- Requests to add new particles, forces, or unsupported mechanisms
- Rhetorical critique without technical substance

Issues or pull requests that fall outside scope may be closed without detailed response.

## Contribution Process

- Use GitHub Issues for questions or suggestions tied to specific content.
- Use Pull Requests for concrete edits or additions.
- Keep changes focused and minimal.
- Clearly state the motivation and intended improvement.

## Tone and Conduct

All engagement should remain professional and technical. The goal is to improve clarity and rigor, not to win arguments.

## Project Status

UETC is not peer reviewed and is under active development. The framework may evolve, be refined, or be partially invalidated as analysis and evidence warrant.

Contributing implies acceptance of these conditions.
