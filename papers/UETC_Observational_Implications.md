# Observational Implications

This document outlines the observational implications that follow from the core UETC framework.

It does not introduce new foundational assumptions. All interpretations here are derived from the definitions, constraints, and structural principles established in the Core Framework document.

The goal is not to claim confirmation, but to identify where UETC would be expected to manifest, where it could be constrained, and where it may fail.
