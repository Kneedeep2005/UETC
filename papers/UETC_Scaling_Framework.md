# Scaling Framework

This document defines how scaling is treated within the Unified Electromagnetic
Toroidal Cosmology (UETC) framework.

Scaling in UETC is **structural and comparative**, not an assertion of exact
self-similarity, fractal behavior, or parameter invariance across physical scales.
The purpose of this framework is to establish what may be compared across systems,
what must vary, and where such comparisons are expected to fail.

This document serves as the canonical reference for scaling-related statements
within UETC.

## 1. Meaning of Scaling in UETC

Within UETC, *scaling* refers to the recurrence of similar **organizational
constraints and geometric outcomes** across systems operating under different
physical parameters.

Scaling does **not** imply:
- identical governing equations across scales,
- identical numerical values of physical quantities,
- or universal power-law relationships.

Instead, scaling denotes that systems may organize into comparable structural
forms when subject to analogous stability, continuity, and energetic constraints.

---

## 2. Structural Invariants

UETC treats the following features as **form-invariant** across scales when
conditions permit:

- closed-loop or toroidal electromagnetic field topology,
- continuity of field circulation without open endpoints,
- organization driven by minimization of energetic leakage and instability,
- emergence of structured propagation environments characterized by effective
  parameters (e.g., the propagation parameter \(u(x)\)).

These invariants describe **form and organization**, not magnitude.

---

## 3. Scale-Dependent Quantities

The following quantities are explicitly expected to vary with scale:

- characteristic length and time scales,
- field strengths and energy densities,
- dominant interactions (e.g., kinetic, electromagnetic, gravitational),
- environmental density and boundary conditions.

UETC does not require proportionality or similarity between these quantities across
systems. Their variation is a defining feature of scaling, not a violation of it.

---

## 4. Comparative Scaling Parameters

Where comparison across scales is appropriate, UETC favors **dimensionless or
normalized parameters** over absolute quantities.

Examples include:
- ratios of characteristic lengths to system-defining radii,
- normalized field curvature measures,
- propagation descriptors expressed relative to vacuum-limit behavior,
- energy partitioning ratios rather than absolute energies.

Such parameters enable cross-system comparison without asserting identical
dynamics.

---

## 5. Relationship to Existing Scaling Frameworks

UETC scaling is intended to be compatible with, and constrained by, established
scaling approaches in:

- classical electromagnetism,
- plasma physics and magnetohydrodynamics,
- general relativity (where applicable),
- wave propagation in structured or refractive media.

UETC does not replace these frameworks. It provides an additional structural lens
through which scaling behavior may be compared and interpreted.

---

## 6. Domains of Breakdown

UETC scaling is expected to lose relevance or fail in regimes where:

- electromagnetic field organization is negligible,
- system behavior is dominated by incoherent or stochastic processes,
- boundary conditions prevent sustained field structure,
- or observational resolution is insufficient to support structural inference.

Identification of such breakdown domains is considered a necessary outcome of
rigorous evaluation.

---

## 7. Explicit Non-Claims

This framework does **not** assert:

- exact scale invariance of physical law,
- fractal cosmological structure,
- equivalence between microscopic and cosmological systems,
- or universal scaling exponents governing all systems.

Any interpretation requiring such assumptions lies outside the scope of UETC.

---

## 8. Connection to Observational Constraints

Scaling analyses within UETC must remain consistent with observational constraints
documented elsewhere in this repository, including but not limited to:

- black hole electromagnetic domain scaling,
- heliospheric boundary measurements,
- galactic-scale magnetic field observations,
- constraints imposed by CMB isotropy and large-scale homogeneity.

Scaling comparisons are treated as **tests**, not confirmations.

---

## 9. Role Within the Framework

This Scaling Framework exists to:
- standardize language and expectations around scaling,
- prevent overextension of analogy,
- and provide a disciplined basis for cross-scale comparison.

All scaling-related claims within UETC should be evaluated against the definitions
and limits established here.

---

## Closing Statement

Scaling within UETC is a tool for comparison, not a conclusion.

Its value lies in clarifying where structural similarities are meaningful, where
they are coincidental, and where they are prohibited by observation or theory.
