# Unified Electromagnetic Toroidal Cosmology (UETC)

## Abstract

Unified Electromagnetic Toroidal Cosmology (UETC) is presented as a working structural framework for interpreting propagation behavior and large-scale organization in systems where electromagnetic field geometry and density variation play a significant role.

Rather than introducing new particles, forces, or speculative entities, UETC emphasizes first-principles electromagnetic structure, closed-loop field geometries, and effective propagation descriptions derived from observable behavior. A central organizing parameter, expressed as an effective propagation modifier, is used to relate geometric structure to measurable propagation effects without asserting violation of established physical limits.

The framework is not proposed as a replacement for existing theories, nor as a finalized cosmological model. Its intent is to provide a coherent organizational perspective that connects laboratory-scale, heliospheric, and astrophysical observations under a common structural language while remaining open to constraint, refinement, or falsification.

This document serves as a technical overview and reference point for the UETC repository and associated materials.
