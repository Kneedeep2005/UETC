# Core Framework

This document defines the core concepts, assumptions, and structural mechanisms of Unified Electromagnetic Toroidal Cosmology (UETC).

The emphasis here is on:
- precise definitions,
- internally consistent structure,
- cross-scale applicability,
- and clear boundaries on claims.

Mathematical expressions are included only where they clarify structure or mechanism. Full formal closure is outside the scope of this phase.
