# Core Framework

This document defines the core concepts, assumptions, and structural mechanisms of Unified Electromagnetic Toroidal Cosmology (UETC).

The emphasis here is on:
- precise definitions,
- internally consistent structure,
- cross-scale applicability,
- and clear boundaries on claims.

Mathematical expressions are included only where they clarify structure or mechanism. Full formal closure is outside the scope of this phase.

## 1. Definitions and Scope

This section establishes the core definitions, scope boundaries, and assumptions used throughout the Unified Electromagnetic Toroidal Cosmology (UETC) framework.

All later sections depend on the terms and constraints defined here.

### 1.1 Scope of the Framework

UETC is a structural and mechanistic framework intended to describe how electromagnetic field geometry, density variation, and propagation behavior organize physical systems across scales.

It is concerned with:
- large-scale and cross-scale structure,
- field-mediated propagation effects,
- stable geometric configurations observed in natural systems.

UETC does not attempt, in its current phase, to provide a complete replacement for existing formalisms or a closed mathematical system.

### 1.2 Core Assumptions

The framework proceeds from the following assumptions:

1. **Electromagnetic fields possess real structure**  
   Electromagnetic fields are treated as physically structured entities capable of forming stable geometries, rather than as purely abstract mathematical constructs.

2. **Field geometry matters**  
   The spatial configuration of fields, including curvature and topology, plays an essential role in system behavior and stability.

3. **Density gradients influence propagation**  
   Effective propagation speed and path depend on local field and medium properties, which may vary spatially.

4. **Toroidal configurations are energetically favorable**  
   Toroidal and looped field structures naturally arise as stable, self-organizing configurations across many observed systems.

5. **Scaling behavior is continuous**  
   The same organizing principles apply across scales, even when specific physical parameters differ.

### 1.3 Explicit Non-Assumptions

UETC does not assume:
