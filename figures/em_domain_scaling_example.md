# Example Electromagnetic Domain Scaling Plot

## Purpose

This figure provides an illustrative visualization of the normalized electromagnetic
domain scaling framework described in:

`observational_constraints/black_holes/em_domain_scaling.md`

The plot is intended to show how selected black hole systems may be placed within
the framework using dimensionless normalization. It is not presented as a fitted
model, universal law, or predictive relation.

## Description

The horizontal axis represents a normalized black hole mass coordinate, compressing
many orders of magnitude in mass into a bounded interval for comparative purposes.

The vertical axis represents the dimensionless electromagnetic extent parameter:

\[
\Xi = \frac{R}{R_s}
\]

where \(R\) is an observed electromagnetic structure scale and \(R_s\) is the
Schwarzschild radius of the central black hole.

Plotted points correspond to representative black hole systems placed using published
mass estimates and commonly used observational proxies (e.g., jet extent or
large-scale synchrotron emission).

## Interpretation Notes

- The figure is **illustrative** and intended for comparative visualization only.
- No fitting, trendlines, or scaling exponents are implied.
- Object placement is not tuned to enforce agreement with any theoretical model.
- Scatter between objects is expected due to environmental effects, duty cycles,
  projection uncertainties, and observational limitations.
- The absence of an object from this figure does not imply inconsistency with the
  framework.

## Scope and Limitations

- The figure does not attempt to capture all electromagnetic regimes for any object.
- Proxy choices may evolve as higher-quality observations become available.
- The figure may be revised, replaced, or expanded as additional data are incorporated.

This visualization should be interpreted as a snapshot of a developing comparative
framework rather than a finalized result.
