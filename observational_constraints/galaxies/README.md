# Observational Constraints – Galaxies

This directory is reserved for observation-driven constraint analyses related to
galactic-scale electromagnetic structure, rotation behavior, and large-scale
field organization.

The focus of this section is not to reinterpret galactic observations wholesale,
but to document where existing measurements place constraints on structural and
propagation-based explanations within the UETC framework.

Potential topics tracked here include, but are not limited to:
- large-scale magnetic field morphology in spiral and irregular galaxies,
- correlations between electromagnetic structure and rotation behavior,
- propagation effects associated with extended galactic environments,
- observational limits on density-layering or refractive behavior at galactic scales.
- **DES / DECam Late-Time Structure Measurements**  
  Late-time galaxy clustering and weak-lensing constraints from the Dark Energy Survey, treated as a boundary condition on effective propagation and structure-based interpretations.

At this stage, no claims are asserted and no resolutions are proposed.
Entries in this directory are intended to remain model-agnostic, revision-safe,
and grounded in published observational data.
