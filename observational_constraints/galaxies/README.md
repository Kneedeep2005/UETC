# Observational Constraints – Galaxies

This directory is reserved for observation-driven constraint analyses related to
galactic-scale electromagnetic structure, rotation behavior, and large-scale
field organization.

The focus of this section is not to reinterpret galactic observations wholesale,
but to document where existing measurements place constraints on structural and
propagation-based explanations within the UETC framework.

Potential topics tracked here include, but are not limited to:
- large-scale magnetic field morphology in spiral and irregular galaxies,
- correlations between electromagnetic structure and rotation behavior,
- propagation effects associated with extended galactic environments,
- observational limits on density-layering or refractive behavior at galactic scales,
- **DES / DECam late-time structure measurements**, treated as boundary conditions
  on effective propagation and structure-based interpretations.

## Current entries

- **Exploratory: Density-Gradient–Based Inference Scaler (Working Hypothesis)**  
  `density_gradient_inference_scaler.md`  
  A minimal, bounded, dimensionless inference-scaling law motivated by cumulative
  exposure to density gradients along photon paths. Recorded as a testable
  organizing hypothesis, not a precision fit or resolved explanation.

- **Exploratory: NGC 2403: Normalized-Radius Overlay on Conceptual u(x)**  
  `ngc2403_normalized_overlay.md`  
  An illustrative, non-fitted shape comparison between a conceptual u(x) response
  and the observed NGC 2403 rotation curve using shared normalized-radius
  coordinates. Intended to motivate broader, falsifiable tests.

At this stage, no claims are asserted and no resolutions are proposed.
All entries are intended to remain model-agnostic, revision-safe,
and grounded in published observational data.

**Status:** Partially populated (working hypotheses and illustrative constraints)
