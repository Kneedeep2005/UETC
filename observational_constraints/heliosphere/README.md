# Observational Constraints – Heliosphere

This directory is reserved for observation-driven constraint analyses related to
the heliosphere and its interaction with the local interstellar medium.

The heliosphere is treated here as a well-measured, large-scale electromagnetic
boundary system, providing empirical constraints on field structure, density
gradients, and propagation behavior relevant to the UETC framework.

Potential topics tracked in this section include:
- heliospheric boundary structure (termination shock, heliosheath, heliopause),
- large-scale magnetic field geometry and asymmetry,
- density and pressure gradients inferred from in-situ and remote measurements,
- propagation effects associated with heliospheric refractive or boundary behavior,
- observational limits derived from Voyager, IBEX, and related missions.

This directory does not assert that the heliosphere is a direct analog for
cosmological-scale systems. Its role is to provide a constrained, observation-rich
environment for evaluating electromagnetic structure and propagation effects.
