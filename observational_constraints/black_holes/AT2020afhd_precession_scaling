# AT2020afhd Disk–Jet Precession Scaling

## Observational Summary
The tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2020afhd exhibits synchronized quasi-periodic variability
in both X-ray and radio emission with a period of 19.6 ± 1.5 days.
The modulation is interpreted in the literature as disk–jet co-precession
consistent with Lense–Thirring (frame-dragging) precession of a tilted, thick accretion flow.

The analysis adopts a black hole mass prior of:
log(M•/M⊙) = 6.7 ± 0.5

and infers a dimensionless spin parameter in the approximate range:
a• ≈ 0.11–0.35 (positive spin favored).

No assumptions beyond those stated in the source publication are made here.

## Scaling Extraction

Define the gravitational radius:
R_g = GM / c²

and a dimensionless coherent-precession radius:
ρ ≡ R_coherent / R_g

Using the standard weak-field Lense–Thirring precession scaling,

Ω_LT ≈ 2a / (ρ³ t_g),   where t_g = GM / c³,

the observed precession period P = 2π / Ω_LT
can be inverted to estimate the characteristic radius:

ρ ≈ (2a / (Ω t_g))^(1/3)

## Resulting Scale (AT2020afhd)

Using:
P = 19.6 days  
M• ≈ 10^6.7 M⊙  
a• ≈ 0.11–0.35  

yields a characteristic coherent-precession radius of approximately:

ρ ≈ 10–20 R_g   (central estimate)

Corresponding to a physical scale of order:
R ≈ 0.3–1 AU

The uncertainty is dominated by the black hole mass prior and the assumed spin range.

## Interpretation Scope

This file reports only the observationally anchored scaling implied by the measured
precession period under standard assumptions used in the literature.

Any interpretation of this radius as a structured or coherent coupling domain
is model-dependent and treated separately.
