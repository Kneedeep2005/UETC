# Black Hole Observational Constraints

This section documents observation-driven constraints related to black hole systems within the Unified Electromagnetic Toroidal Cosmology (UETC) framework.

The entries collected here do not propose alternative black hole models or replace standard relativistic descriptions. Instead, they identify regimes where structural, scaling, and propagation considerations impose limits on how black hole environments may be interpreted.

Each document serves as a boundary condition rather than a confirmation case.

## Contents

- **Growth-Time Constraints on Ultramassive Black Holes**  
  Examines well-known growth-time tensions for ultramassive black holes under standard assumptions, motivating investigation of extended structure and domain-based interpretations without asserting resolution.

- **Electromagnetic Domain Scaling Framework**  
  Introduces a dimensionless, GR-baselined framework for discussing coherent electromagnetic domains surrounding black holes across mass scales.

- **AT2020afhd Disk–Jet Precession Scaling**  
  A worked observational example using measured disk–jet coprecession to infer characteristic coherence scales in gravitational units, without introducing new physics.

- **TON 618 (Ultramassive Black Hole)**  
  An extreme-mass black hole treated as an upper-bound scaling and structural constraint. TON 618 anchors discussions of allowable domain extent, inner and outer boundary behavior, and identifies a regime relevant for future comparative lensing and propagation studies.

## Scope Notes

- No entry in this section assumes exact geometric realization.
- No numerical parameter fitting is performed within UETC.
- Comparative analysis across black hole systems (e.g., M87*, Sgr A*) is recognized as important but deferred until a consistent cross-scale framework is established.

This section is intended to constrain interpretation, not to establish proof.
