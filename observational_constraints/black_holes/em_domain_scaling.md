# Normalized Electromagnetic Domain Scaling Framework

## Overview

Black hole systems span many orders of magnitude in mass, luminosity, and physical
extent. Direct comparison of electromagnetic structure across this range requires
a normalization scheme that factors out geometric scaling predicted by general
relativity.

This section introduces a comparative, observationally grounded framework for
analyzing electromagnetic domains associated with black hole systems. The goal is
to enable consistent placement of systems on a shared scale without tuning or
model-dependent fitting.

This framework is intended as a testable, extensible methodology rather than a
finalized physical law.

## Schwarzschild Radius as a Baseline

General relativity predicts that the characteristic length scale associated with
a non-rotating black hole is the Schwarzschild radius:

\[
R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}
\]

Any physical structure tied directly to the black hole must ultimately scale with
this radius. Normalizing observed electromagnetic extents by \(R_s\) removes the
trivial linear dependence on mass and allows comparison across systems.

This approach does not modify general relativity; it uses GR as the geometric
baseline against which additional structure is evaluated.

## Dimensionless Electromagnetic Extent

We define a dimensionless electromagnetic extent parameter:

\[
\Xi = \frac{R}{R_s}
\]

where:
- \(R\) is an observed electromagnetic structure size,
- \(R_s\) is the Schwarzschild radius of the central black hole.

This normalization enables comparison of electromagnetic organization across
systems ranging from stellar-mass black holes to ultramassive quasars.

## Normalized Mass Coordinate

To visualize scaling behavior across a wide mass range, a normalized mass
coordinate may be defined:

\[
x(M) = \frac{\log_{10}(M / M_{\min})}{\log_{10}(M / M_{\max})}
\]

where:
- \(M_{\min}\) represents the lower bound of known black hole masses,
- \(M_{\max}\) represents the upper bound of observed ultramassive systems.

This coordinate compresses many orders of magnitude in mass into a bounded interval
while preserving relative ordering.

## Observational Proxies for Electromagnetic Domains

Electromagnetic structure associated with black holes is not characterized by a
single scale. Instead, multiple observational proxies trace different physical
domains. This framework distinguishes three commonly observable regimes:

### 1. Inner Jet Collimation Scale
- Distance over which relativistic jets transition from collimation to expansion.
- Typically traced via VLBI radio observations.
- Represents the innermost organized electromagnetic outflow region.

### 2. Gas-Aligned Outer Domain
- Extent of aligned ionized, molecular, or atomic gas correlated with jet or field
  orientation.
- Traced via CO, HI, optical emission-line filaments, or X-ray cavities.
- Represents electromagnetic influence on the surrounding galactic or circumgalactic medium.

### 3. Radio Synchrotron Domain
- Large-scale synchrotron-emitting structures such as lobes, halos, or extended
  diffuse emission.
- Traced via low-frequency radio observations.
- Represents long-lived or fossil electromagnetic structure.

Each proxy captures a distinct physical regime and should not be conflated with
the others.

## Placement and Interpretation

Objects placed within this framework are not tuned to fit the scale. Placement is
determined solely by:
- observed structure size,
- estimated black hole mass,
- and normalization by \(R_s\).

The framework does not assume that all systems occupy all three regimes, nor that
scaling must be identical across regimes. Scatter is expected due to environmental
effects, duty cycles, and observational limitations.

The value of the framework lies in identifying systematic trends or separations
between regimes, not in enforcing a single universal relation.

---

## Scope and Limitations

- This framework is comparative, not predictive.
- It does not assert causation between electromagnetic domains and black hole mass.
- It does not replace detailed magnetohydrodynamic modeling.
- Observational uncertainties in mass and structure size are acknowledged.

As additional data become available, objects may be added to this framework to
further test scaling behavior and regime separation.

## Relevance to UETC Development

Normalized electromagnetic domain scaling provides a structured way to compare
observed electromagnetic organization across black hole systems. Within the UETC
context, this framework supports investigation of whether coherent electromagnetic
structure persists systematically beyond the immediate gravitational radius.

No claim is made that this framework alone validates UETC. Instead, it serves as a
testable organizational tool that complements other observational constraints and
motivates further study.
