# Observational Constraints Index

This directory collects observation-driven constraint analyses relevant to the
Unified Electromagnetic Toroidal Cosmology (UETC) framework.

The purpose of these sections is to document **empirical limits and boundary
conditions** derived from existing measurements, not to assert resolutions or
reinterpret observations wholesale. Each subdirectory focuses on a specific
physical regime where electromagnetic structure, density gradients, or
propagation behavior place meaningful constraints on UETC.

All entries are intended to remain model-agnostic, revision-safe, and grounded in
published observational data.

> **Scope alignment note:**  
> Within the current UETC repository scope, observational-constraint sections
> are treated strictly as **boundary conditions on exploratory interpretation**.
> UETC does not claim to replace ΛCDM, dark matter, dark energy, or established
> relativistic/gravitational physics.  
>  
> Any discussion of galactic-scale behavior is limited to **inner-galaxy
> inference and structure** (central few kiloparsecs), where baryonic modeling
> uncertainty, plasma effects, and non-circular motions are already known to be
> relevant. Outer flat rotation curves, cluster-scale lensing, and global
> cosmological dynamics remain outside the framework’s current explanatory
> scope.

## Constraint Categories

- **Black Holes**  
  [`black_holes/`](black_holes/)  
  Observation-driven constraints derived from compact-object systems, including
  growth-time limits, electromagnetic domain scaling, and disk–jet behavior,
  treated using published measurements and standard baseline assumptions.

- **Galaxies**  
  [`galaxies/`](galaxies/)  
  Galactic-scale electromagnetic structure, rotation behavior, and large-scale
  field organization.

- **Heliosphere**  
  [`heliosphere/`](heliosphere/)  
  Directly measured electromagnetic boundary structure and propagation behavior
  within the heliosphere and its interaction with the local interstellar medium.

- **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**  
  [`cmb/`](cmb/)  
  High-precision observational constraints that any structural or
  propagation-based framework must respect.

- **Intergalactic Medium (IGM)**  
  [`intergalactic_medium/`](intergalactic_medium/)  
  Low-density, large-scale environments placing limits on propagation effects,
  electromagnetic structure, and cross-scale consistency.

## Status

Most sections currently serve as **placeholders** to preserve scope and intent,
with selected categories partially populated. Content will be added incrementally
as analyses are formalized and documented.

The presence of a category does not imply unresolved tension or proposed revision;
it indicates an observational domain that constrains the framework.
