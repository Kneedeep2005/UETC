# Observational Constraints Index

This directory collects observation-driven constraint analyses relevant to the
Unified Electromagnetic Toroidal Cosmology (UETC) framework.

The purpose of these sections is to document **empirical limits and boundary
conditions** derived from existing measurements, not to assert resolutions or
reinterpret observations wholesale. Each subdirectory focuses on a specific
physical regime where electromagnetic structure, density gradients, or
propagation behavior place meaningful constraints on UETC.

All entries are intended to remain model-agnostic, revision-safe, and grounded in
published observational data.

## Constraint Categories

- **Galaxies**  
  [`galaxies/`](galaxies/)  
  Galactic-scale electromagnetic structure, rotation behavior, and large-scale
  field organization.

- **Heliosphere**  
  [`heliosphere/`](heliosphere/)  
  Directly measured electromagnetic boundary structure and propagation behavior
  within the heliosphere and its interaction with the local interstellar medium.

- **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**  
  [`cmb/`](cmb/)  
  High-precision observational constraints that any structural or propagation-based
  framework must respect.

- **Intergalactic Medium (IGM)**  
  [`intergalactic_medium/`](intergalactic_medium/)  
  Low-density, large-scale environments placing limits on propagation effects,
  electromagnetic structure, and cross-scale consistency.

## Status

Most sections currently serve as **placeholders** to preserve scope and intent.
Content will be added incrementally as analyses are formalized and documented.

The presence of a category does not imply unresolved tension or proposed revision;
it indicates an observational domain that constrains the framework.
