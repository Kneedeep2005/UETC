# Observational Constraints – Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)

This directory is reserved for observation-driven constraint analyses related to
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and its measured statistical properties.

Within the UETC framework, the CMB is treated as a high-precision observational
boundary condition rather than as a phenomenon to be rederived or replaced.
Existing CMB measurements and standard statistical characterizations are accepted
as valid and internally consistent within their established modeling context.

Potential topics tracked in this section include:
- constraints imposed by CMB angular power spectra,
- limits on large-scale propagation or refractive effects consistent with observed anisotropies,
- scale-dependent boundary behavior that must remain compatible with CMB isotropy,
- observational tolerances within which alternative structural interpretations must operate.

This directory does not assert a reinterpretation of the CMB itself, nor does it
propose alternative early-universe models. Its purpose is to document the
constraints that CMB observations place on any framework invoking modified
propagation, density layering, or large-scale electromagnetic structure.
