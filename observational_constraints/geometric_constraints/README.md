# Geometric Constraints

This section documents mathematically defined geometric and topological constraints that inform UETC’s structural framing across scales.

These entries are **not** presented as direct physical models of specific systems, and they do not constitute observational evidence. Their role is to provide rigorous reference geometries and stability considerations that help bound what kinds of toroidal configurations are plausible under symmetry and energy-minimization assumptions.

## Contents

- **Clifford Tori (reference toroidal geometry)**  
  A highly symmetric, stable toroidal geometry used as a bounding analogue for closed-loop toroidal structure.

## Scope Notes

- This section focuses on geometry and topology, not cosmological parameter fitting.
- Observational matching, when applicable, is handled in the relevant observational constraint categories (black holes, galaxies, heliosphere, CMB, intergalactic medium).
