# Observational Constraints – Intergalactic Medium (IGM)

This directory is reserved for observation-driven constraint analyses related to
the intergalactic medium (IGM) and low-density regions between bound astrophysical
systems.

Within UETC, the IGM is treated as a sparsely measured but physically relevant
environment where propagation effects, large-scale electromagnetic structure,
and density gradients may place constraints on cross-scale interpretations.

Potential topics tracked in this section include:
- observational limits on intergalactic magnetic fields,
- dispersion and propagation constraints inferred from fast radio bursts (FRBs),
- absorption and scattering limits derived from quasar spectra,
- large-scale homogeneity and isotropy constraints applicable to low-density media,
- consistency requirements with established cosmological distance measures.

This section does not assume that the IGM exhibits strong or coherent structure,
nor does it assert that intergalactic observations require reinterpretation.
Its purpose is to document empirical limits that
